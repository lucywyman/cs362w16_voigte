There are no differences between my dominion.c outputs and the two other
student's dominion.c implementations based on my random tester.

This no doubt means my tester is not thorough enough. That said it's well over
250 lines now and I'm not really sure the best way to be more through without
growing this assignment exponentially.

For those interested I also included dominion.c coverage at the end of each
output, they all agreed on the following:

    File 'dominion.c'
    Lines executed:46.82% of 581
    dominion.c:creating 'dominion.c.gcov'

I have included <username>-testdominion.out in this repository so you can view
the differences easily.
