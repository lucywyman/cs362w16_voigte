Report by: Lucy Wyman (wymanl)
On code written by: Elijah Voigt (voigte)
For: CS 362 Final Project

Bug 1:
======

To reproduce:
-------------
``make runRandomCard`` once.

The Error:
----------
"Status: 51 failures and 175 successful uses of the mine"

Bug:
----
It looks like the mine card is failing 25%-50% of the games played, likely
because the mine card can only be played in certain conditions (if the player
doesn't have enough gold or has too much copper, or has less than 3 coins,
and so on), and if those are not fulfilled the mine card returns -1. However,
the author doesn't check for these conditions before attempting to play 
the mine card, so if they try to play the mine card there's basically
just a random chance that the mine card will fail because the gamestate 
conditions are not met.

The author made note of the error in the original code for ``randomtestcard.c``
but didn't investigate the error further or determine where the bug might be.

The Solution:
-------------

Probably just check for conditions before playing the card and play a different
card if they're not met, or handle the mine card error and play a different 
card.
