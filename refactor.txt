# Refactors

## Assignment 1 Changes:

- replaced the following functionality in cardEffect's switch with proper
  functions:
    - adventure
    - council room
    - feast
    - mine
    - remodel
    - gardens

This involved copying code over and adding arguments / creating variables until
my linter / the compiler was happy.

This implementation includes at least 2 incorrect pieces of code.
